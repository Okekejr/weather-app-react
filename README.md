# weather-app-react

weather-app-react uses the https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#data API for its data, it was a quick redo of my previous weather app which is made in vanilla javascript, this weather app is made with react.js


## How to use?

query the API through the input field provided with ONLY the city name and if it has a hyphen replace it with an underscore, and hit enter. VIOLA!!
